<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Anjali Chauhan, a driven and detail-oriented Computer Science student at Lokmanya Tilak College, specializing in Data Science. Currently in my third year of studies, I'm passionate about unlocking insights and driving decision-making through data.</p>

<p>With a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, I'm expanding my skill set in data manipulation tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI. My interests lie in Machine Learning, and I've already explored projects in sentiment analysis and churn prediction. I'm eager to dive deeper into advanced algorithms and analysis techniques.</p>
